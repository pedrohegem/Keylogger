# Keylogger
Python based simple keylogger that captures keystrokes on a client machine and sends the data to a remote server which logs the received keystrokes for later analysis.
- `keylogger.py`: Captures user keystrokes and sends them to the server in real-time, running discreetly in the background.
- `log_server.py`: Collects and stores keystrokes received from the cliente.
